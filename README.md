# Solving a Real-World SQL Problem: Unique Hackers and Maximum Submissions perÂ Day
In today's data-driven world, SQL remains a powerful tool to derive insights from raw data. Recently, I encountered a challenge that required solving an interesting problem related to a coding contest. The task was to analyze contest submissions to find:
1. The total number of unique hackers who made at least one submission each day(starting from the first day of the contest).
2. The hacker with the maximum number of submissions each day. If multiple hackers had the same maximum, the hacker with the lowest hacker ID was to be returned.
